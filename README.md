# cheatsheets
Cheat/formula sheets I've written for various classes.

# Building
To build the PDFs with Tectonic:
```sh
make pdf
```

Then all the PDFs should be available under the `build/` directory.

To build the website version with Pandoc:
```sh
make html
```

Then you can open `build/index.html` to look through all the cheatsheets.
