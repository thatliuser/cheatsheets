\textbf{Base conversion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Decimal to base $n$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Successive division: divide the target number by $n$ and collect the remainders, until the number reaches 0. The converted number should be the remainders, from last to first.
        \item Ex. $(8)_{10} \rightarrow 4 r 0, 2 r 0, 1 r 0, 0 r 1 \rightarrow (1000)_2$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Base $n$ to decimal:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Positional conversion: multiply each number with the corresponding power of $n.$
        \item Ex. $(1000)_2 = 0 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1\cdot 2^3 = 2^3 = 8$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Binary to/from hex/octal:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bit grouping: put bits into groups of 3 (octal) or 4 (hex) and convert using a table.
        \item Ex. $(10111100)_2 = (1011 1100)_2 = (BC)_{16}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hex to/from octal:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert to binary and use binary to/from hex/octal.
        \item Ex. $(AF)_{16} = (1010 1111)_2 = (010 101 111)_2 = (257)_8$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Representing negatives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sign magnitude
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert the number's absolute value to binary, then stick a 1 in front of it to represent that it's negative
        \item Ex. -8 in 5-bit sign magnitude: $(8)_{10} = (1000)_2 \rightarrow -8 = 11000$
        \item Max value in $n$ bits: $2^{n - 1} - 1$
        \item Min value in $n$ bits: $-2^{n - 1} + 1$
    \end{itemize}
    \item One's complement
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert the number's absolute value to binary, then complement all the bits.
        \item Ex. -8 in 5-bit one's complement: $(8)_{10} = (1000)_2 \rightarrow -8 =   \sim 01000 = 10111$
        \item Max value in $n$ bits: $2^{n - 1} - 1$
        \item Min value in $n$ bits: $-2^{n - 1} + 1$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Two's complement
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert the number's absolute value to binary, then complement all the bits and add one.
        \item Ex. -8 in 5-bit two's complement: $(8)_{10} = (1000)_2 \rightarrow -8 = (\sim 01000 + 1) = (10111 + 1) = 11000$
        \item Max value in $n$ bits: $2^{n - 1} - 1$
        \item Min value in $n$ bits: $-2^{n - 1}$
        \item Adding and subtracting use the same circuit
        \item Overflow can only occur with 2 positive or negative values. If both values are positive and the output is negative, overflow happened and vice versa.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Binary coded decimal}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each decimal digit is represented by 4 bits
    \item Certain range for each digit (A - F or 1010 - 1111) is invalid
    \item To add, we have to skip this range; if the sum of two digits is above 1001 we must add 6 (0110) and propagate the carry to the next set of digits
    \item Ex. 2 + 9 =
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{cccccc}
            % WORKAROUND: Pandoc has parse errors without these phantom markers
            \phantom{ }  & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \\
            + & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \\
            \hline
            \phantom{ }  & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & \\
            + & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & \\
            \hline
            \phantom{ }  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & c 1\\
        \end{array}
        = 0001 0001 = (11)_{10}
    \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Boolean algebra}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simplification theorems
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(X \cdot Y) + (X \cdot \overline{Y}) = X$
        \item $(X + Y) \cdot (X + \overline{Y}) = X$
        \item $X + (X \cdot Y) = X$
        \item $X \cdot (X + Y) = X$
        \item $(X + \overline{Y}) \cdot Y = X \cdot Y$
        \item $(X \cdot \overline{Y}) + Y = X + Y$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Demorgan's law: $\overline{(X + Y)} = \overline{X} \cdot \overline{Y}$, $\overline{(X \cdot Y)} = \overline{X} + \overline{Y}$
    \item Consensus theorem
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $X \cdot Y + Y \cdot Z + \overline{X} \cdot Z = X \cdot Y + \overline{X} \cdot Z$
        \item $(X + Y) \cdot (Y + Z) \cdot (\overline{X} + Z) = (X + Y) \cdot (\overline{X} + Z)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item There are $2^{2^n}$ possible functions for $n$ one-bit inputs.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Combinational logic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minterm: an AND of each input together, complemented if its value is 0.
    \item Sum of Products: minterms added together to represent a function. 0 outputs are excluded.
    \item Maxterm: an OR of each input together, complemented if its value is 1.
    \item Product of Sums: maxterms multiplied together to represent a function. 1 outputs are excluded.
    \item K-maps
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You can ONLY group bits in sizes of $2^n$.
        \item You can ONLY group bits in rectangles / squares.
        \item Maps overflow back around the edges.
        \item SOP form: simply circle the largest groups of 1s and see which variables have to be on or off for the range to work. Each group is a SOP term and multiplied together to form the function..
        \item POS form: circle the largest groups of 0s and see which variables have to be on or off to work. Each group is a POS term (inverted!) and added together to form the function.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hazards and glitches
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Two types: static and dynamic. Static = unwanted pulse, dynamic = unwanted change (e.g. 0 when 1 desired)
        \item Preventing static hazards: ensure no disconnected groups in K-maps; all groups should have at least 1 overlap.
        \item SOP: static-1 hazards can occur where the output pulses to 1 when it's meant to stay at 0.
        \item POS: static-0 hazards can occur with the same idea as SOP.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Logic tech}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiplexers: select 1 of $2^n$ bits as output, based on $n$-bit selector.
    \item You can use multiplexers to split up complex K-maps into smaller groups: choose $n$ variables as selectors!
    \item BE SURE to connect the sub-functions for each portion to the correct input based on selectors! Ex: $0 = \bar{S_1}\bar{S_0}$, $2 = S_1\bar{S_0}$.
    \item Demultiplexer: choose one of $2^n$ bits as output, based on $n$-bit selector and 1-bit input.
    \item Same principle as multiplexer but backwards. Useful as a kind of switch.
    \item You can hook the input bit to 1 and choose output bits fed to an OR gate to generate functions, based on minterms.
    \item PLAs and PALs: PLAs have programmable AND and OR arrays, PALs have hardcoded OR arrays.
    \item Z state: high impedance; acts as if output is disconnected from parent circuit.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Sequential logic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sync vs async circuits: sync only updates \texttt{@(posedge clk)}, async updates anytime.
    \item Latches: can hold state by abusing propagation delay
    \item Flip-flops: latches but synchronous, only updateable on \texttt{@(posedge clk)} which is less prone to glitches.
    \item Clocks: Rectangular signals with a regular period. Duty cycle is the percent time the clock is high per period.
    \item Registers: $n$ flip-flops cascaded together
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Flip-flop types}
\begin{itemize}
    \item RS | reset-set inputs. 1 and 1 is an invalid state because it may cause oscillation.
    \item JK | jump-kill inputs. All inputs are valid, 1 and 1 state oscillates at half the clock speed so it's controlled. (toggle mode)
    \item T | toggle input. No invalid state.
    \item D | data input. Also no invalid state; the flip flop will simply set itself to the value of D.
\end{itemize}

    0 & 0 & X & 0 & 0 & X & 0 & 0 \\

    1 & 1 & 0 & X & X & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    \hline
\end{tabular} \\
\textbf{Finite state machines}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Moore machine: output logic depends only on current state. Slower but more stable.
    \item Mealy machine: output logic depends on state and current input. Glitcher but faster.
    \item Counters: FSMs that cycle through a specific sequence.
    \item Self-starting counters: counters that account for "invalid states" and direct them to a valid path.
    \item General layout of FSMs: Inputs, update logic, register, and output logic.
\end{itemize}
